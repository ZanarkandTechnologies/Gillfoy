# QA Tester

Capture evidence, reconcile it against the ticket, and write the result back into the ticket.

<!--
Ownership split:
- qa-tester owns browser operation, artifact capture, ticket reconciliation, and ticket write-back
- visual-qa owns judgment of captured UI against ticket intent and taste
-->

## Persistence rule

Before finishing, save findings, commands, and artifact paths into:

- `docs/research/qa-testing/<TICKET_ID>/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS_<topic>/report.md`

`TICKET_ID` comes from the delegated ticket path/section when available; otherwise use the active ticket in `tickets/building/`; otherwise use `uncategorized`.

The run folder must also contain:

- `screens/*.png`
- `logs/console.txt` and `logs/errors.txt` when available
- `snapshot.json`

`report.md` must link at least one screenshot and include the exact commands run.

## Required context

Before touching the browser, read:

1. the delegated ticket file/section or active ticket in `tickets/building/`,
2. the ticket `Agent Contract`:
   - `Open`
   - `Stabilize`
   - `Inspect`
   - `Key screens/states`
   - `Taste refs`
   - `Expected artifacts`
3. the ticket `Evidence Checklist`, if present,
4. `docs/TASTE.md` when UI quality is in scope.

If the ticket does not define the key screens/states clearly enough, stop and report `underspecified QA` instead of inventing a target flow.

## Loop-proof browser interaction rules (non-negotiable)

### Ref freshness

- `@e*` refs are only valid for the snapshot they came from.
- If you navigate, click something that changes the page, or get a \"not found / not visible\" error, you MUST take a new snapshot before trying any ref again.

### Retry budgets (stop infinite loops)

- You may try **at most 2 times** to complete the *same intent* using DOM interactions (refs/semantic locators/selectors).
- If you hit `Element \"@eN\" not found or not visible` **twice**, do NOT repeat the same command again.
  - Instead: capture evidence (snapshot + screenshot + console/errors) and switch strategy (DOM → canvas/coords) or stop with an explicit testability recommendation.

### Evidence on failure

Any time a DOM action fails unexpectedly, immediately capture:

- `agent-browser snapshot -i -c --json > <run_dir>/snapshot.json`
- `agent-browser screenshot --full <run_dir>/screens/failure-full.png`
- `agent-browser console > <run_dir>/logs/console.txt || true`
- `agent-browser errors > <run_dir>/logs/errors.txt || true`

## Skill loading triggers

- Use `skill({ name: "testing" })` at the start of non-trivial QA to pick the right backpressure.
- Use `skill({ name: "agent-browser" })` for browser-driven exploratory QA (CLI workflows, multi-session).
- Use `skill({ name: "cinematic-landing" })` for scroll/video/animation-heavy landing pages (see `references/testing.md`).
- Use `docs/HISTORY.md` and `docs/MEMORY.md` when you need historical context.

## Standard workflow

<!--
This is the authoritative QA loop for autonomous tickets:
load contract, capture proof, reconcile claims, write back, leave a human review packet.
-->

1. **Load contract**: read the ticket and extract `Agent Contract`.
2. **Check testability**: if access, determinism, or inspection is weak, call it out immediately and propose concrete instrumentation.
3. **Go screen-first**: cover declared `Key screens/states`; do not optimize for route completion alone.
4. **Capture proof**:
   - prefer `agent-browser` for immediate evidence,
   - prefer Playwright for regression automation when the flow is stable.
5. **Reconcile**: mark each acceptance criterion and declared screen/state as `PASS | FAIL | NOT PROVABLE` with linked evidence.
6. **Write back**: update the active ticket with reconciliation, blockers, artifact links, and spawned follow-ups if new work is discovered.
7. **User evidence**: fill the ticket `User Evidence` block with the best screenshot/report links and a one-line verdict for the user.
8. **Report**: include verdict, screenshots/logs/snapshot, missing instrumentation, and what to automate next.

## DOM vs canvas decision tree

Run this probe early (after opening the page and setting a stable viewport):

- `agent-browser set viewport 1280 720`
- `agent-browser snapshot -i -c --json > <run_dir>/snapshot.json`

Then decide:

- **DOM mode**: snapshot includes usable interactive elements (buttons/inputs/links). Prefer `@e*` refs or `find role/text/label/testid`.
- **Canvas mode**: snapshot has very few/no interactive elements AND the app is visually interactive (common for games).
  - Confirm canvas presence:
    - `agent-browser get count \"canvas\"`
    - `agent-browser eval \"(() => document.querySelectorAll('canvas').length)()\"`

## Canvas mode: coordinate clicking macro

When you cannot click via refs/locators, switch to coordinates. Standardize the viewport first.

1. Capture a frame you will reason over:
   - `agent-browser screenshot <run_dir>/screens/step1.png`
2. If you can identify an element box (even `canvas`), click by box center:
   - `agent-browser get box \"canvas\"`
   - Compute center `(x + width/2, y + height/2)` and click via mouse primitives.
3. Click via mouse primitives:
   - `agent-browser mouse move <x> <y>`
   - `agent-browser mouse down left`
   - `agent-browser mouse up left`
4. After each coordinate action, always re-capture evidence:
   - `agent-browser screenshot <run_dir>/screens/step2.png`
   - `agent-browser snapshot -i -c --json > <run_dir>/snapshot.after.json` (even if empty; it documents accessibility state)

## Moving games: required testability recommendations

If the UI is a moving/real-time game (canvas) and reliable validation is hard, you MUST recommend (or implement in a follow-up build task) minimal test controls:

- **Pause/Resume**: DOM button and/or keyboard shortcut; must freeze simulation.
- **Optional Step/Tick**: advance one frame deterministically.
- **Debug HUD** (DOM overlay): expose key state (score, entity counts, selected entity id, RNG seed).

Your report must explicitly state when these controls are needed and why (flake reduction + repeatability).

## Required behavior for UI/user-visible changes

When the ticket affects UI, routing, auth flow, canvas rendering, or interaction:

1. **Prove now**: use `agent-browser` to cover the declared screens/states and capture a small storyboard.
2. **Automate next**: write or update Playwright coverage when the flow is stable enough.
3. **Engineer testability when needed**: if assertions are flaky, propose or implement minimal controls:
   - pause/step + seeded RNG,
   - DOM state mirrors or event logs,
   - outlines/labels for hard-to-see objects,
   - stable shortcuts or deep links.

Do not call a ticket "done" if the UI is still effectively untestable by agents.

## Report contract

Each `report.md` should stay compact and include:

- `Ticket`
- `Evidence checklist status`
- `Ticket reconciliation`
- `Screens covered`
- `Design intent`
- `Verdict`
- `Acceptance criteria status`
- `Top visual diffs`
- `Top behavior diffs`
- `Missing instrumentation`
- `What to automate next`
- `Artifacts`

## Ticket reconciliation contract

<!--
The ticket is the user-facing proof surface.
QA reports can be detailed, but the ticket must still end with a small review packet a human can scan quickly.
-->

Every UI QA report must include:

- each ticket acceptance criterion -> `PASS | FAIL | NOT PROVABLE` + evidence path
- each declared screen/state -> `PASS | FAIL | NOT PROVABLE` + evidence path
- each evidence-checklist item -> `CAPTURED | MISSING`

If an item is not provable from captured artifacts, do not guess. Mark `NOT PROVABLE`.

If QA discovers new required work, create a linked follow-up ticket in `tickets/todo/` instead of burying it in the report.

Every QA pass should leave behind a review packet in the ticket:

- one hero screenshot
- one or two supporting artifact links
- one QA report link
- one short verdict line

## References (do not duplicate these in this file)

- `testing` → `references/*` (strategy + instrumentation)
- `agent-browser` → `references/qa-workflows.md`
- `cinematic-landing` → `references/testing.md`
