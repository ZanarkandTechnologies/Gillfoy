# Ticket Template

Use this template to create ticket files under `tickets/todo/`, `tickets/review/`, `tickets/building/`, or `tickets/done/`.

## Ticket Lifecycle

`todo -> review -> building -> done`

- Start in `todo`.
- Move to `review` while planning and human approval are happening.
- Move to `building` only after approval.
- Move to `done` only after implementation, QA, and final human confirmation.

If larger than L, split the ticket.

## Planning Checklist

- Each ticket file is independently implementable.
- Dependencies are explicit (no cycles).
- Acceptance criteria map to the spec.
- Assignee matches task type.
- Control fields define when the ticket should move and what is blocking it.
- UI-bearing tickets define how agents access the feature, prove it, and delegate from the ticket artifact.
- UI-bearing tickets include a short evidence checklist for screenshots/snapshots/report proof.
- Tickets declare who reviews captured evidence and where that verdict is written back.
- User Evidence gives one compact handoff packet for human review.
