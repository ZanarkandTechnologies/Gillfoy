# Testing Index

Use this skill as a lightweight router to testing guidance across domains.

## Core Pattern
1. Classify the system (CRUD web / API / AI / voice / video / canvas / multiplayer).
2. Pick backpressure (tests, typecheck, lint, build, evals).
3. Choose tools (Playwright where it fits; otherwise domain harnesses).
4. Capture evidence (logs, screenshots, fixtures, traces).

## Domain-Specific Testing
Each domain skill may include `references/how-to-test.md`. This index should list them:

- [index.md](references/index.md) (auto-generated)
