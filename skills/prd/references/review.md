# PRD Review

Run this review before handing off the PRD.
If any answer is weak, tighten the PRD first.

## Must Pass

- Does the problem statement make sense in plain language?
- Does the PRD explain who the user is and what job they are trying to get done?
- Is the proposed slice actually helpful, not just interesting to build?
- Does the PRD explain why this is the right first slice instead of a bigger or different one?
- Are constraints, risks, and non-goals concrete enough to steer implementation decisions?
- Does the PRD define how an agent will deterministically prove the main app or slice, not just how a human might click around?

## Ask If Relevant

- Is this really the best way to help the user, or just the easiest thing to ship?
- Are we solving a real pain point or inventing unnecessary product surface?
- Is there a simpler path that would help the user sooner?
- Are there user assumptions here that still need confirmation?

## Fail If

- the audience or JTBD is vague
- the slice is too broad to guide the next step cleanly
- success is described only in technical terms, not user terms
- the document reads like implementation notes instead of product intent
- autonomous proof is missing for a flow that will later depend on browser or runtime testing
